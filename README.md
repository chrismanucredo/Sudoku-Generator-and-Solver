# Sudoku-Generator-and-Solver
A custom implementation of a sudoku generator and solver. 

## Expected Fuctions
1. Generate a coherent pseudo-random sudoku chart. *done*
2. Generate a solvable sudoku puzzle. *partially done* 
3. Solve solvable sudoku puzzles. *done*

Ad. 2)
The algorithm does not yet generate puzzles that yield unique solutions.

## Future
* Efficiently determine the solvability of a given sudoku puzzle.
* Alter unsolvable sudoku puzzles with as little alterations as possible to make it solvable.
